# Responsive Layout

This week we were responsible with creating a responsive portfolio site. It needed to utilize Bootstrap to handle the styling as well as changing based on the viewport size of a computer, tablet, and laptop.

## Nav Bar

We needed to include a consistent Nav Bar across application. The links needed to take us to the different pages.

## About Me

The About Me page needed to include a profile picture surrounded with information about us. I also included the links to my Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and GitHub.

## Portfolio

## Contact

In this page we were supposed to have a contact form application asking for the user's name, email, and message.
